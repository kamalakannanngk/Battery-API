# Battery Status API Example

This is a simple JavaScript example that demonstrates how to use the Battery Status API to monitor and display information about the device's battery.

## Overview

The Battery Status API provides information about the device's battery, including its charge level, charging status, charging and discharging times after it completes. This example code shows how to:
